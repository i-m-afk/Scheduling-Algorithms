# Scheduling-Algorithms
 This repository contains a collection of Java code implementations for various process scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The repository provides ready-to-use code for popular scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.
 
Included Scheduling Algorithms:
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and build the `Main.java` it will create all the `.class` files
2. Create Process objects with the required attributes (e.g., ID, burst time, arrival time, priority).
3. Instantiate the desired scheduling algorithm class with the array of Process objects.
4. Customize and extend the code as needed to suit your specific requirements.

### Key Features:
- Modular Design: Each scheduling algorithm is implemented as a separate class, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- Extensible Architecture: The repository is designed to accommodate additional scheduling algorithms by creating new classes that extend the base Algorithm class.
- Code Reusability: The code can be integrated into larger projects or used as a reference for understanding scheduling algorithm concepts.

### To do :
- A visualiser of these algorithms
